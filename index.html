			<b>What was the project</b>- Project was named as Project Kumhaar. Kumhaar was basically creation of dustbins using clays made by different potters.
			<b>Why i did it</b>- As Enactus is an international nonprofit organization dedicated to inspiring students to improve the world through entrepreneurial action. I did it because i wanted to do something to improve the lives of people, to do something for humanity. So enactus provides a platform to create community development projects and present it at global level, so i got a golden opportunity to pursue one of my interest.
			<b>What was my contribution</b>- As the project head, my job was to see smooth functioning of the project, also to keep-in check the deadlines. Also i went to different places to contact different potters who were unemployed or working for very less money. So Project kumhaar helped the potters to earn more money and also helped them to showcase their talents.

			<b>What is the project</b>- Room keeper provides the facility of reservation of a particular room at a time slot on a particular day subject to its availability.Book any room in advance : Seminar hall,Auditorium,Labs,Classes etc. Target Platforms are Android and Web.
			<b>Why i am doing it</b>- We choose it as our major project. The Northcap University is well equipped with the keepers of its security (the guards), integrity (the teachers) and reputation (the alumni). Despite all this, it was lacking the one to keep records of its rooms’ availabilities. The sole agenda of designing Roomkeeper is to save those ambitious people (both students and teachers) some valuable time, which otherwise is wasted in getting the rooms reserved. This application will help them to check as well as book, any available room in the university for their upcoming requirement, just in a button-tap. 
			<b>What is my contribution</b>- It is targeted on two platforms- Android and Web. Since i've had an experience of working in projects related to web and designed applications and websites using PHP, so my job is to create an application on the web as to collect different data coming out from app and also gives the facility to book rooms through web application also.
